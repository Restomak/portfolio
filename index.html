				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> My goal in game design is to spread enjoyment and fun, to help people unwind and relax, and maybe forget the negative things in their lives for a little while. I want to make people smile and have a good time.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header-bold">Summary</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> I’ve spent my entire life as a game designer and the greater part of my life as a programmer. I’ve spent so long with both in my life, in fact, that I’ve been creating games and calling myself a game designer since long before I realized I’m genderfluid and trans. Now, I’m as much a part of the LGBTQIA+ community as I am a game designer and TTRPG dungeon master. I also make and sell handmade resin dice, I develop and moderate for the web browser game Mafia.gg, and I'm always coming up with new game ideas to build upon and create!</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">Gingerbread Escape</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> I’ve been a game designer since I was in first grade. My parents love to tell the story about how I came home from school one day with a board game I’d made in class, and how it changed my life forever. I was so excited to have them play it that they simply couldn’t say no, and so in short order we were playing <i>Gingerbread Escape</i>, a game about a freshly-baked gingerbread man trying to make its escape out of the kitchen without being caught by the dog. It was a simple game, with elements from both <i>Snakes and Ladders</i> as well as <i>Candyland</i> (two of my favourite games at the time), and inspired simply by our dog who would charge into the kitchen and gobble up anything we'd accidentally dropped-- my mother’s gingerbread cookies included!</p>
						<p class="other-text"> When my parents tell this story, they love to mention that they were expecting just to humor an excited first-grader for an hour, spending time as a family, before just moving on-- and that unexpectedly, they ended up having a great time playing! My dad states that later, I revealed to them that when I grew up I wanted to make games. When he asked me why, the answer I gave to him was my mission statement above (albeit spoken with a first-grader’s vocabulary). Both my desire to make games and the reason for that have not changed even slightly in all those years; game design is and always will be my dream.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">My Introduction to Programming</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> As luck would have it, I was given the option in grade 9 to take a mixed shop & tech class. I enjoyed the workshop half of the class but only with mild curiosity when compared to how much I enjoyed the tech half of it; we were taught my first ever programming language: <i>Object Oriented Turing</i> (OOT).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> I hyper-fixated on OOT with a passion paralleling only my interests in both making and playing games. I quickly learned that I could actually use it to make games, and so the first one I ever programmed was a little Mario platformer with rigid physics that took place all on one screen-- everything was tiny and it didn't really have any design theory used in making the level, but I <em>loved</em> it nonetheless.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> In grade 10, I disassembled a simple side-scrolling space game that came with the OOT language disk. My best friend and I were so ahead of the class that the teacher let us do whatever we wanted, and so I delved through the source code in class, learned how they implemented side-scrolling, and put it to use in my new creation. It wasn’t perfect; the physics were still very rigid, and the graphics and sound effects were shamelessly grabbed from online. However, what I’d managed to create was a dirty replication of the first four levels of SMB1, side-scrolling included. My friends and I were ecstatic.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> OOT became my focus for a long time. I was too far ahead of the class for the teacher to help, and I didn’t have another programming course for another 4-5 years, so all of my programming knowledge during those years was self-taught. I would take apart more programs that came with the disk and I’d spend hours reading through the help manual to learn new functions. I made a great many games, many of which were never finished; I’d get bored and put most of them aside as soon as I learned <em>how</em> to make them. Some of the games, however, I put a little more work into. These were the first games that followed my mission statement, rather than just being made as tools to help me learn more programming: <i>Platform Dance</i>, <i>Brick-a-Block</i> (in its earliest form), <i>Super Mario Bros Custom</i>, and a text-based adventure that eventually instead became a pen and paper adventure, marking my first steps into being a dungeon master (DM) for Table-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs).</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br>
				<h3 class="other-header">Table-Top Role-Playing Games</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> My first ever pen-and-paper adventure was a mess. My brother was the only one to ever fully play through it, and although it’s where I got the namesake Restomak, nothing else about it is worth mentioning. However, I had been introduced to the concept of TTRPGs, and while I didn’t dive into it immediately, it would be something I picked up with great passion later on in my life.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The first real TTRPG adventure I ever DMed was a D&D game for my brother and two cousins. A small mining town had their mines overrun with goblins and hobgoblins, and they were hired to investigate. After a bit of fighting down in the mines, the party resurfaced to recuperate, and the rogue (played by my brother) discovered the mayor played a part in the goblins problem in the mines. A master of disguise, my brother's character single-handedly caused a riot in town forcing the mayor to retreat into his mansion. The town was on their side, now, and they were more prepared than ever before to delve back into the mines and wipe the problem out once and for all. They succeeded, however my younger cousin’s character (a fighter) died in the final battle. He was given a proper burial, a heroic tale was told about his death, and the adventure came to a close with all the loose ends wrapped up neatly. All three players were hooked and wanted more adventure-- something I gave them not too long later with a larger party, and in it their characters (years into the future) were told the now-exaggerated tale of my younger cousin’s character’s death. They loved it.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The spark and energy I feel when running TTRPGs is the same as how I feel when designing games, and this feeling is amplified when I DM for newer players. Few things compare to making players fall in love with a game, especially knowing how much of a hand you had in the creation process. For new players, it’s especially important to reassure them that there’s no harm in trying things, that there’s no stupid questions, and that there’s nothing I’d love more than to be patient and help them learn the game. I <em>strongly</em> believe this reasoning can be applied to introductory levels of video games; a properly-designed tutorial section (or introductory campaign, in the case of TTRPGs) can make the difference in whether a player gets attached to a game or puts it down immediately.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> To this day I continue to DM, usually running at least one campaign, but sometimes I'll juggle two at once (one of them usually for beginners). I love sitting at my desk or lounging somewhere with my tablet, poring over my notes and scheming new events, drizzling foreshadowing all over current ones and tying all the stories together in a big homebrew universe. It's one of my absolute favourite pastimes.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Put plainly, I <em>love</em> creating stuff for people to enjoy.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">Discovering my Gender Identity</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> After a few years at Algonquin College and achieving my Advanced Diploma for Game Development, I’d spent a bunch of time working on some of my own projects-- but never really pushed to get into the field of game design professionally. I felt something was missing, though I wasn’t sure what that was. In the meantime, I instead worked a lot on two of my personal projects I’d grown pretty attached to: <i>Extreme Cow Racing</i> and <i>Brick-a-Block</i>. <i>Brick-a-Block</i> was a game I’d made many years back, and with the help of my brother (who I’d taught programming) and my cousin (who was in college as a graphic designer), the game was vastly improved. However, attrition eventually hit us: my cousin found a job, my brother started college, and I-- looking to more easily move to the US (my girlfriend at the time was American)-- began taking courses at Concordia University in order to get a degree in Computer Science.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Away from family and friends and taking full-time courses, many of which felt extremely redundant to me (zero of my college courses counted as credits), I succumbed to depression. As this was an extremely difficult time in my life, I will gloss over it. However, while at University, I not only learned a great deal of new programming knowledge and tricks (such as the importance of time and space complexity), I learned possibly the single most important thing I could: the existence of gender identities outside of the binary.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Discovering I was genderfluid and trans was similar to as if I'd had spent my entire life living in a pitch-black room and only finally turned on the lights. Problems and weird feelings I’d been bumping into all my life-- things I knew were there but never quite knew what they were-- were suddenly crystal clear to me. For the first time, I knew what was missing before I went out into professional life: knowing how I wanted to be <em>me</em>. It was suddenly easier to seek out help, to do everyday tasks, to get my work done, amd to simply feel <em>happier</em>. It has changed my life, and finally I feel able to move forward again.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">Mafia.gg</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> Returning to live once again with family due safety reasons with the COVID-19 pandemic, I finally put in some work towards professional life. I reached out to an acquaintance of an acquaintance: one of the lead developers for the web browser game <i>Mafia.gg</i>, and told him I wasn’t sure if the team was looking to accept new members, but that I was interested and would love to work on the game with them.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> After a successful interview and an introduction to the team (several of whom I was already acquainted with), I began learning their source code, and with the help of another team member, put forward my first addition to the game: two new roles, one of which was an immediate and huge hit with the community. Confidence bolstered, I’ve since added much more to the game. I’ve added vote quoting, a feature long-desired by the community; I’ve created and implemented many new roles; I’ve added flavour text to pre-existing roles and worked with the team in the creation of our new FAQ, making the game friendlier to newer players; and more, including an April Fool’s day event item that has the community to this day impatient for its return.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Today, I continue to add more to the game. I now host popular event games for the community, and I'm regularly designing new roles and quality of life features. I've recently created a new Ready Check feature to give hosts more control over their lobbies before they begin a game!</p>
					</div>

				<br>
				<h3 class="other-header">More Projects</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> <i>Mafia.gg</i> isn’t the only thing I’ve been working on since the beginning of the pandemic; I’ve also begun the hobby of creating handmade resin dice sets, and I sell them in my shop on Etsy. As this is all run by myself, in addition to the actual making of the dice, I am also responsible for marketing as well as communicating with customers to make sure everything is made to their liking. I’ve successfully made 20 sales so far (14 on Etsy), and have managed to maintain a 5-star rating!</p>
						<p class="other-text"> As mentioned earlier, however, workshop-style creation pales in comparison to the passion I have for making games. As such, I’ve been working on several new projects, including a nearly-finished new board game! With the working title Greedy Wizards, it has already been through seven rounds of playtesting (with several having no prior knowledge of the game nor input from me throughout), and so far everyone who’s played it has loved it. While my other projects aren't yet ready to be shown to the public, I'm hard at work nearly every day refining my game design, programming, and storytelling skills.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> With my life on track, it’s time for me to begin a new chapter in my life: with my passion for game design, as a career.</p>

					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<img src="images/mafia.png" class= "imagePortfolioBigIntro border border-2 rounded" alt="Mafia.gg logo">
						<p class="other-text-caption"> "Mafia.gg is an online, text-based version of the classic party game Mafia. Each player is secretly assigned a role aligned with either the town or the mafia. The mafia eliminates one town member per night, and act like innocent town members during the day. The town must combine their wits and eliminate the true mafia before they're outnumbered!" -<a href="https://mafia.gg" target="_blank">Mafia.gg</a> guide page</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> Mafia.gg attracted me like a moth to a flame. When I first joined iateyourpie's Twitch streaming community, I was quickly enraptured by how they played and would find myself up late at night invested in the outcome of each game. When I joined the team around a year later, I was ecstatic to be a part of something I already loved.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Mafia.gg's code-base is primarily split into Java (engine) and Javascript (client). Most of the work I've done has been in the engine, though most of the quality of life features I've added have required some work in the client as well. Both the vote quoting and the upcoming host Ready Check button are examples of this, while the upcoming features that I've designed for our Deck Builder tool (available to patrons) are instead made for a Java Swing application. New roles, however, are done entirely within the engine, and of the 29 roles that have been released since my joining the team, I have either designed or implemented (often both) 13 of them (with more awaiting the next update).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> With each new role I make, there are one or more goals I try to accomplish (alongside making the role both fun and balanced). Oftentimes one of these goals is to combine existing mechanics to make something new and exciting. The Prosecutor role is an example of this; it works similarly to a combination of both the Jailer and the Party Host, which are both existing roles with very different powers that the Prosecutor combines and twists to make something new. When the Prosecutor chooses a player to interrogate at the end of the day (similarly to the Jailer's power, though the Prosecutor can only do it once), it pulls everybody into one big meeting to watch (much like the Party Host's power, except that more like the Jailer's power, only the Prosecutor and chosen player may speak during the meeting). What the Prosecutor does that's new, however, is that instead of being the one to choose whether or not their target is killed (as the Jailer would), each other player is given the option to decide whether or not they believe the Prosecutor's chosen player is <em>Guilty</em> or <em>Innocent</em>. The chosen player only has the duration of the night to plead their case to everyone watching, and if the majority of players vote <em>Guilty</em>, the player dies. The Prosecutor is therefore a powerful role that can prevent other night meetings from happening (similarly to the Party Host), which prevents the Mafia's nightly kill, with the down-side that the Mafia are also on the jury. As such, the results of the prosecution can be swayed slightly in the Mafia's favour, especially if the town doesn't agree with one-another with their votes. Since all votes are anonymous, Mafia can take advantage of this to attempt to safely protect one of their own, or attempt to kill someone that truly is innocent.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Another common goal of mine when creating new roles is to engage players more if they find themselves with the basic Villager role. There are a number of roles in the game that see themselves as basic Villager despite being something different, and I enjoy making more of these so that there are different varieties hosts can select for their lobbies. Playing as a basic Villager and then finding out you have a special power later on can be exciting, and so I've created a number of roles that do exactly that: the Trickster, upon being condemned, can choose another player to hand a Gun. However, the Trickster must also choose whether or not this Gun is broken-- and only the Trickster knows the result of that choice. A working Gun will allow the holder to kill a target of their choice, while a broken gun will misfire and kill the holder instead. The Trickster is therefore able to be used to give a trusted player the ability to kill someone they suspect is Mafia, or they can hand it to someone they suspect is Mafia and try and convince them they're trusted so that the player takes themselves out of the game. Since the Trickster only has limited time to make their choice, they could end up making a choice that ends up benefiting the Mafia, and that risk only adds to the excitement!</p>
						<p class="other-text"> I am a big fan of roles that force the player to think about when and how they're using their power, or roles that force a player to make a choice. One of my newest roles, the Tactician, leaves the player powerless for the first three days, and on the third they may choose which power they receive between two other existing roles in the game-- and this choice will affect how they play for the rest of the game. Another of my newest roles, the Deathcaller, is a mafia-aligned role that will kill a player of their choice during the day, but only if the Deathcaller is currently voting that target. The Deathcaller must carefully time the use of this power so that they're killing someone without revealing themselves, as town will know the Deathcaller is among the people who were voting the targeted player. The Prosecutor and Trickster, both mentioned above, each have their own sets of choices as well; the timing of the Prosecutor's power and the player they choose can drastically affect the outcome of the game, and the Trickster's choice may cause the right or wrong player's death. All powers must be considered and used carefully to get best results.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Mafia.gg is comprised of eight team members, and we are tightly-knit and work well together. Frequent communication is necessary to make sure our goals align and to make sure everything runs smoothly, and it is not uncommon for us to have small meetings to discuss new ideas and implementation, as well as update organization, community events, and moderation. I find myself collaborating regularly with team members, and I have proven myself as a valued member of the team since my joining. As for the community and user-base, I work diligently to ensure our community stays a safe, friendly, and inclusive environment for all.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header" id="greedy-wizards">Greedy Wizards</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<img src="images/greedyWizards.png" class= "imagePortfolioBigIntro border border-2 rounded" alt="A screenshot of Greedy Wizards in Tabletop Simulator">
						<p class="other-text-caption"> Greedy Wizards is a 4-6 player board game based on cooperation and backstabbing. You must work together to survive and escape the dungeon, but only the player who hoards the most treasures will emerge the winner!</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> Creating fun board games has long been a passion of mine, stretching back to my first ever experience in game design. Greedy Wizards touches upon a genre I find interesting: the concept of being forced to work together when your real goal is to come out on top of a power struggle that lasts the entire game. My design philosophy for Greedy Wizards is broken down into several goals:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="other-text"> To give the players a strong need to cooperate</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To tempt players into looking out for themselves instead</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To prevent the game from ever having a clear winner until the last moment</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To encourage a light-hearted mood through whimsy and goofiness</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To keep the game from going on too long</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="other-text"> Greedy Wizards has several key mechanics in play that force cooperation. The first, and perhaps most important, is the Monster; it begins the game behind the party, and slowly moves towards them throughout the game. If the Monster ever catches the party, the game ends and nobody wins. The party will run into several spaces with the word "STOP" on them, and these spaces cannot be passed until the players overcome an Obstacle Card. Since the only way to do this is for one or more players to use some of their resources against the Obstacle Card specifically, players are forced to cooperate lest the Monster catch up and end the game. This mechanic takes care of both the first and last points above.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Players' resources come in the form of Scroll Cards. Each of these cards can <em>either</em> be used against an Obstacle Card, or they can be used to advance the players' win condition (each of the 16 different Scroll Cards except one have a different method of doing this that I won't discuss here). Since spending your resources on an Obstacle Card to help the party costs you some of your ability to advance your win condition, the temptation arises to ignore the obstacle and hope another player feels pressured into helping instead. A common strategy players have been using is to spend a Scroll Card to take the Party Leader Token for themselves (which allows them to play first each round), so that there is less chance everyone will leave it to them to save the party from certain doom. This causes even the turn order to become a resource available for players to use against one-another.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Since Treasure Cards, whose total points determine the winner at the end of the game, take up the same hand space as Scroll Cards (with a limit of 10 combined in your hand at one time), players must make a choice between carrying more resources or carrying more treasures. Since Scroll Cards can also be used to either mess with or defend yourself from other players, those with more Treasure Cards will find themselves in less of a position to defend said Treasure Cards from being discarded (or worse: stolen). This design approach is to ensure no player ever pulls so far ahead that they are unreachable in score, which in turn ensures that the game never has a clear winner until the end.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Finally, given that competitive games have the very real possibility of worsening the atmosphere of the game table, I wanted there to be a lot of whimsy and goofiness in the game's flavour text. And so, speaking of flavour, one of the zero-point Treasure Cards (pictured below) is simply named, "Cherry-flavoured leather shoe" - I've had many players wonder aloud how that treasure got to be named as such, for why would anyone taste the shoe and find out? Additionally, each Obstacle Card has flavour text explaining the scenario of the obstacle. For instance, if a lightly-torn painting of a bull asks you to stop and meditate, there are several Scroll Cards that help you overcome that puzzle. Kindling, Fireball and Drench would all cause damage to the poor painting, while Mending would remove its tear and potentially cause it to be so thankful that it considers the request complete. Finally, Enlightenment and Silence complete the puzzle in a more normal manner, although one could argue that Silence simply causes the painting to shut up so the party can move on. Functionally, all of these things do the same: overcome the obstacle. It's left up to players' imaginations, however, how exactly the Scroll Card they used got the job done.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Board games are an excellent medium for implementing good game design techniques, and so they are always something I enjoy creating. A good board game, just like any good game, pays special attention to each of its parts and how they work with one-another, so that the end result is not only cohesive, but fun.</p>

						<p class="other-text"> Back in late 2020, I learned about the new fad of resin dice crafting. The idea sounded incredible and I wanted in, so after a bunch of research on the things I would need to have and several spreadsheets of planning out costs and funding, I found myself with everything I needed to dive right in. I've come a long way since then, having learned a lot of techniques through both research as well as trial and error, and I've made over 25 sets! Most of these have been sold on my Etsy TTRPG dice store, which I've named Soul Dice.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The processes of creating, managing, and marketing my shop have all been huge learning experiences. All in all, it has been a very satisfying hobby, and it has been a lot of fun creating something both related to my interests and uniquely different from my usual creativity. I plan on continuing it as soon as I get the custom-made dice masters I've ordered in the mail; I have plans to improve my techniques and make even more beautiful dice than before! Speaking of the dice I've made before, the sets shown above are some of my favourite sets that I've created. The one on the bottom-right, named Seafarer's Expedition, is the one I kept for myself. I get a vibe of old seafarer's maps and exploration from the set, and so I painted the numbers brown except for the highest face of each die-- I painted those red, like the X on a fictional pirate map!</p>

						<p class="other-text-caption"> "Brick-a-Block is a two-directional platforming game. You are Leggo, a resourceful frog living in an explosive, ever-changing landscape. The items you find can improve your odds of survival, but how long can you last in a world where even the sky seems out to get you?"</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> Brick-a-Block is a game built with C# and using Monogame whose origins date back over 15 years ago. I came up with the original concept while playing Super Smash Bros. Melee, while my brother and I were playing in one of the Kirby levels with blocks that fell from the sky. We would attempt to build bases and chuck bombs at one-another. Sometimes, the blocks ended up being bombs themselves! I decided to make a mini-game based on the idea, with more types of blocks and several usable items for digging or blowing things up. We would have fun playing it once in a while, and the game went through many iterations of me digging it back up again after some time and making a new version with improved graphics, gameplay and features. In 2017, however, I decided it was time to make it into a fully-fledged game headed for a Steam release. We started as a team of four and worked together to properly flesh out the concept and focus on making it a lot more fun than just a simple minigame.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Over the next couple years of working on and off in between university work, I continued to improve the game: adding new blocks and items, as well as new features, maps, and game modes. The team I built eventually increased in size to six when we added a sound designer and a pixel artist, and together we developed several versions of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQP4RUyC4ATePOil4oB77A5g2UDnwvSN/view" target="_blank">working demos</a> (though the current developer version is far ahead of the latest of these). However, due to COVID-19 and several other complications in our lives, we felt we no longer had the time to devote to working on the game. The project was shelved for the forseeable future.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Brick-a-Block takes the aforementioned "blocks falling from the sky that you can make a base out of" concept and pushes it to the extreme. With over 20 different types of blocks, each with their own unique effects and visual indicators, the landscape itself becomes rife with dangers and variety. Since I wanted to give Leggo some level of control over the landscape, there are also around 15 different items, split into two categories: passive items and active items. Passive items function similarly to equipped gear with durability that runs out over time, and active items that have one-use effects. Passive items change the way you interact with the game (for example, the Pogo Stick makes you jump higher, and the Climbing Gear allows you to hook onto walls and perform wall jumps). Active items, on the other hand, have quick and snappy effects (such as the Lobbomb, which allows you to toss a stick of dynamite to blow up blocks, or the Flash Freeze, which halts all falling blocks and converts them into Ice Blocks). Both types of items spawn frequently, so that the player always has something to do beyond dodging obstacles (we even have a special function for spawning items more quickly when the player is trapped between blocks, so as to not let them feel stuck for long).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The game was built around maximum replayability; block spawns, item spawns, the Randonoid item's effects, and several other aspects of the game are all consistently random while playing, making every single time played a different experience. We also have several game modes: Climb, in which you attempt to survive while the falling blocks slowly build upon themselves until you climb 300 blocks up (all the way from a molten lava beginning up to outer space and beyond); Endless, in which you play smaller and more contained levels at a casual pace with no real goal beyond surviving in a sandbox that you get to affect with your presence; and Collection (shown above), which works similarly to Endless, but with specially-designed levels of increasing difficulty for each map type in which the goal is to collect eight or more frog coins to complete the level (collecting more than the required amount increases your high score).</p>

						<p class="other-text"> In Wolf Wool Save You, you play as a non-violent wolf whose voice has been stolen by nefarious sheep. To retrieve it, you must find your way into their hidden lair in a nearby well and sneak past the guards until you reach the chest, containing your voice, near the end. Finding your voice alerts all sheep to your presence, after which you must survive an escape sequence to emerge from the lair victorious. As one of the AI programmers for this game, my responsibility was the pathfinding each sheep uses when trying to hunt you down once you've either been noticed or have begun the escape sequence that lasts until the end of the game.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The first check a sheep performs for chase-pathfinding is to line trace to your character. If you're in direct line of sight, they will simply charge straight at you, avoiding any need for heavier computation. If you're not in line of sight, it checks whether or not you're in the same <em>room</em>, which is a different ID given to each section of the map with assigned connection points to one-another and labeled "exits" for each connection point. If you are in the same room, that infers that there's an obstacle between you and the sheep (otherwise the line tracing would have succeeded), and it uses basic A* pathfinding to reach you. If you aren't in the same room, it calculates the fastest room-path to the room you're in using a different method of A*, meant for nodes, to determine which exit of the room to head towards. It then uses the previously-mentioned basic method to reach that exit before entering the next, where it repeats the process and calculates the path to the next exit.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> During the stealth portion of the game, the sheep only registers the location you were last seen, and pathfinds to that location (if you are found again, it updates). Once reaching that point, if you are not found, the sheep concludes their search for you and pathfinds back to the closest checkpoint in their patrol pattern. In the escape sequence, however, the sheep are always aware of your location, and their destination point updates each time you move.</p>

Now, your friends are your ruthless opponents as you each attempt to shift the odds, trying to hit the jackpot and avoid the after-race cleanup!" -Extreme Cow Racing instruction manual</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> I came up with the idea for Extreme Cow Racing back in 2009, when my brother and I found a minigame in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles about cow racing. The concept of the minigame was pretty simple: you bet on one of eight cows, trying to determine which will win the race. However, these are cows; they move at their own pace. We found ourselves on the edges of our seats shouting at the cows to keep going, "Stop taking breaks! You're so close, please just go-- noo!" The cow would halt to munch on some grass, another cow would pass it, and that cow would win the race instead. It was a fun minigame, but I wanted to make something better. From that desire, <i>Extreme Cow Racing</i> was born.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Extreme Cow Racing has the players bet on 2-3 cows (depending on number of players) rather than just one, and no longer are you only always betting on which cow finishes first; you try and guess their placement instead (eg. betting that the yellow cow will be 3rd, the blue cow 4th, and the purple cow last). Additionally, and the most important change that Extreme Cow Racing brings to this concept: the players now have the ability to influence the race. Players are given Modifier Tokens: five each, that replenish every round. Each player may select two of these tokens to place on different cows face-down, and when it's time for the cows to move, how much they move (if at all) can be altered. The effects of the tokens vary from minor increases or decreases in the amount a cow moves, to much larger effects such as big boosts only to cows in behind, or even cowtipping: knocking the cow over and preventing it from moving again until someone finds a token that can get them back on their feet.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> In the end, however, these are still just cows; they move at their own pace. It was very important to keep this core concept as part of the game, and this is done via Moovement Cards: the manifestation of each cow's free will. Each round, after the players have played their tokens, a Moovement Card is drawn for each cow. These cards each have a number from 1-3 (1 being the most common and 3 being the most rare), indicating how far a cow desires to move that turn, before applying players' modifier effects to that number. However, there's another type of Moovement Card that can be drawn: "Moo" cards, designated by a red 'M', which signify the cow's desire to simply stay put and do nothing. If one of these is drawn, that cow refuses to move, and none of the modifiers that alter the amount the cow moves have any effect that round. With these cards added, we found that once again we would be at the edge of our seats, this time praying that the cow we played a Modifier Token on wouldn't just ignore our desperate efforts to get them to <em>moove</em> when we wanted.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Of course, setting an atmosphere of fun and whimsy is extremely important to me in a competitive board game, and each of our Moovement Cards has a terrible cow joke written on it. "What do you call the milk from a cow that's just given birth? De-calf-einated!" - "What happened to the lost cattle? Nobody's herd." - and so on. These dumb jokes, combined with the cows' own refusal to cooperate with the people 'steaking' their imaginary fortunes on the race, keep the game silly and light-hearted.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The game very quickly became a family favourite that we still often play to this day. Many years and many iterations since its inception (altered by various first-time and experienced players' playtests), the game is more or less completed, and awaits some time when I have the resources to spend on getting it polished and released to the public.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> Platform Dance is a two-dimensional arcade-style game in which your only goal is to survive, and your final score depends on how long you're able to do so. I created Platform Dance back in December of 2008 with the goal of experimenting with programming; I was still extremely new to it all, and wanted to try making a new game as practice. Conceptually, Platform Dance is pretty simple. You play as this weird fish/frog creature, and you're able to move in four directions and cannot fall off the platform. The only danger is the falling rocks, which are indicated with growing shadows until they finally appear on screen, heading towards their indicated platform segment. Once they reach the ground, that platform segment is destroyed, and that spot on the grid is no longer accessible. Since the locations in which the rocks will fall are all random, the player must make judgement calls repeatedly as to where they think the platform will remain most intact for the longest. If they get trapped, eventually a falling rock will land on them, ending the game.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The player has a couple items as tools to prevent the platform from completely disappearing over time from the falling rocks. A wrench used when facing an empty grid space will recreate the platform segment in that location, and the player can use this to either round out the area they're trying to stay in, or they can use it to bridge a gap to a larger (and therefore likely safer) area. Nets are another item available to the players, and they work similarly to a wrench except that instead of creating a platform segment in that spot immediately, a block must fall on it first. Players have to use nets carefully, as they're useful for regaining platform segments, but they can very easily trap themselves by using it in a space they later wish they hadn't (due to later having a wrench they wish they could use on that spot instead).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Rocks don't fall on a regular interval or maintain the same frequency throughout the game, and a visual indicator at the bottom-right corner of the screen shows a "danger level" which gives the player a rough estimate as to the frequency of falling blocks; the larger the indicator, the more blocks will fall. Once this danger indicator fills up entirely, it resets, and the player has a short breather with less falling rocks as it slowly begins to build again. Combined with the available items, the player is able to last for quite some time, assuming they have both skill and luck.</p>

						<p class="other-text"> Back in early 2008, my friends and I were pretty into old Mario games. I had already recreated the original Super Mario Bros's first world as a hobby (to learn how to properly make side-scrolling games), and having just learned how to program file saving and loading, I was pretty excited about the idea of creating both a level editor and level player. I never actually finished this project, having only implemented the tilesets of both overworld and underground levels (no water levels nor castle levels). The user interface was also extremely unintuitive, however it was a learning experience that enabled a lot of fun level design opportunities among my friends that didn't exist until years later when Nintendo launched their first Mario Maker game.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Looking back on it now that both Mario Maker and Mario Maker 2 have been released, it's interesting to see how many features exist as overlap between my old 2008 editor and the professionally-made editors used today. The level designer could save and load .canvas files with the Level Editor, which were blank or partially-filled level templates, and finished levels would save as either .elvl, .mlvl, .hlvl, or .xlvl - depending on the difficulty the level designer thought their level was (e for easy, m for medium, h for hard, and x for extra hard). There were options to change the soundtrack that would be played with each level, and the user had a lot of customization with objects like blocks or enemies: blocks could be made hidden or contain items or coins, and enemies could be altered depending on the type you wanted for them (green or red koopas or parakoopas, or adding piranha plants to pipes, etc). The flagpole could also be moved closer to the beginning of the level, allowing players to customize the length of their level.</p>

						<p class="other-text-caption"> Pictured above is the map of Skeln: the region encompassing one of my most recent Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, Vital Containment, which featured horror elements inspired by the Resident Evil series.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> TTRPGs have long been a passion of mine. Having a group of friends all hanging around, focused on the same game while also providing me an outlet for my desire to create, has always been an experience I've enjoyed. I've created a number of various TTRPG campaigns over the years, ranging from your basic adventures such as invasions of the mines in a mining town, to creepy games in which the players are trapped in a village that's <em>far</em> too happy given the situation they're in, to goofy one-shot adventures in which all adventurers save one ended the session transformed permanently into chickens. All of my campaigns have the same goal: provide a setting and loose plot for the characters to stumble around in, to explore themselves and my world, and above all: to have fun. Fun is, and always will be, the primary goal of any TTRPG campaign- or any game- I create.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Most of my campaigns feature lower-level characters, as I often have at least one player completely new to TTRPGs as a genre. I enjoy guiding new players, teaching them through small puzzles or less difficult situations the things they can do (they can do pretty much anything, and that's often a hard concept to grasp at first), and slowly making them fall in love with their characters and the genre as a whole. Many of my closest friends had never tried TTRPGs until I introduced them, and now they're always looking forward to the next session or new campaign I make!</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Every campaign I've ever run, as well as the ones I'm currently running or plan on creating-- all of them are within a setting of my own creation. I'm not a big fan of running modules made by other designers when it comes to TTRPGs, as a large part of the fun to me is the design! Not all of the design is done ahead of time, however; my best campaigns have always left room for creating things on the fly. My most recent campaign (and the one I'm still in the middle of running) is entirely, 100% created on the fly! The players love finding out what goofy thing I'm going to come up with next, and are often baffled by how things somehow flow together seamlessly despite next to no planning storylines in advance. All in all, I love devoting my time and attention to creation, and TTRPGs are one of the best outlets there are for that.</p>
