				<h3 class="other-header-bold">Mission Statement</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> My goal in game design is to spread enjoyment and fun, to help people unwind and relax, and maybe forget the negative things in their lives for a little while. I want to make people smile and have a good time.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header-bold">Summary</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> I’ve spent my entire life as a game designer and the greater part of my life as a programmer. I’ve spent so long with both in my life, in fact, that I’ve been calling myself a game designer since long before I realized I’m trans and genderfluid. Now, I’m as much a part of the LGBTQIA+ community as I am a game designer and TTRPG dungeon master. I also make and sell handmade resin dice, and I develop and moderate for the web browser game Mafia.gg</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">Gingerbread Escape</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> I’ve been a game designer since I was in first grade. My parents love to tell the story about how I came home from school one day with a board game I’d made in class, and how it changed my life forever. I was so excited to have them play it that they simply couldn’t say no, and so in short order we were playing <i>Gingerbread Escape</i>, a game about a freshly-baked gingerbread man trying to make his escape out of the kitchen without being caught by the dog. It was a simple game, with elements from both <i>Snakes and Ladders</i> as well as <i>Candyland</i> (two of my favourite games at the time), and inspired simply by my mother’s gingerbread cookies and our dog who’d charge into the kitchen and gobble up anything we’d accidentally dropped.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> When my parents tell this story, they love to mention that they were expecting just to humor an excited first-grader for an hour, spending time as a family, before just moving on-- and that unexpectedly, they ended up having a great time playing! My dad states that later, I revealed to them that when I grew up I wanted to make games. He asked me why, and my answer to him was my mission statement (albeit from a first-grader’s vocabulary). Both my desire to make games and the reason for it have not changed in all those years; game design is my dream.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">My Introduction to Programming</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> As luck would have it, I was given the option in grade 9 to take a mixed shop & tech class. I enjoyed the workshop half of the class but only with mild curiosity when compared to how much I enjoyed the tech half of it; we were taught my first ever programming language: <i>Object Oriented Turing</i> (OOT).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> I hyper-fixated on OOT with a passion paralleling only my interests in both making and playing games. I quickly learned that I could make games using it, and the first “game” I ever made and programmed was a little Mario platformer with rigid physics that took place all on one screen-- everything was tiny, but I <em>loved</em> it.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> In grade 10, I disassembled a simple side-scrolling space game that came with the OOT language disk. My best friend and I were so ahead of the class that the teacher let us do whatever we wanted, and so I delved through the source code in class, learned how they implemented side-scrolling, and put it to use in my new creation. It wasn’t perfect; the physics were still very rigid, and the graphics and sound effects were shamelessly grabbed from online. However, what I’d managed to create was a dirty replication of the first four levels of SMB1, side-scrolling included. My friends and I were ecstatic.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> OOT became my focus for a long time. I was too far ahead of the class for the teacher to help, and I didn’t have another programming course for another 4-5 years, so all of my programming knowledge for years was self-taught. I would take apart more programs that came with the disk and I’d spend hours reading through the help manual to learn new functions. I made a great many games, many of which were never finished; I’d get bored and put most of them aside as soon as I learned <em>how</em> to make them. Some of the games, however, I put a little more work into. These were the games that followed my mission statement, rather than just being made as tools to help me learn more programming: <i>Platform Dance</i>, <i>Brick-a-Block</i> (in its earliest form), <i>Super Mario Bros Custom</i>, and a text-based adventure that eventually instead became a pen and paper adventure, marking my first steps into being a dungeon master (DM) for Table-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs).</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br>
				<h3 class="other-header">Table-Top Role-Playing Games</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> My first ever pen-and-paper adventure was a mess. My brother was the only one to ever fully play through it, and although it’s where I got the namesake Restomak, nothing else about it is worth mentioning. However, I had been introduced to the concept of TTRPGs, and while I didn’t dive into it immediately, it would be something I picked up with great passion later on in my life.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The first real TTRPG adventure I ever DMed was a D&D game for my brother and two cousins. A small mining town had their mines overrun with goblins and hobgoblins, and they were hired to investigate. After a bit of fighting down in the mines, the party resurfaced to recuperate, and the rogue (played by my brother) discovered the mayor had his hands in the goblin problem of the mines. A master of disguise, he single-handedly caused a riot in town forcing the mayor to retreat into his mansion. The town was on their side, now, and they were more prepared than ever before to delve back into the mines and wipe out the problem once and for all. They succeeded, however my younger cousin’s character (a fighter) died in the final battle. He was given a proper burial, a heroic tale was told about his death, and the adventure came to a close with all the loose ends wrapped up neatly. All three players were hooked and wanted more adventure-- something I gave them not too long later with a larger party, and in it their characters (years into the future) were told the now-exaggerated tale of my younger cousin’s character’s death. They loved it.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The spark and energy I feel when running these kinds of games is the same as how I feel when making games, and this feeling is amplified exponentially when I DM for newer players. Few things compare to making players fall in love with a game, especially knowing how much of a hand you had in that process. For new players, it’s especially important to reassure them that there’s no harm in trying things, that there’s no stupid questions, that there’s nothing I’d love more than to be patient and help them learn the game. I <em>strongly</em> believe this reasoning can be applied to introductory levels of video games; a properly-designed tutorial level (or introductory campaign, in the case of TTRPGs) can make the difference in whether a player gets attached to a game or puts it down immediately.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> To this day I continue to DM, usually running at least one campaign, but sometimes I'll juggle two at once (one of them usually for beginners). I love sitting at my desk or lounging somewhere with my tablet, poring over my notes and scheming new events, and drizzling foreshadowing all over current ones and tying all the stories together in a big homebrew universe. It's one of my absolute favourite pastimes.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Put plainly, I absolutely love creating stuff for people.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">Discovering my Gender Identity</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> After a few years at Algonquin College and achieving my Advanced Diploma for Game Development, I’d spent a bunch of time working on some of my own projects-- but never really pushed to get into the field of game design professionally. I felt something was missing, though I wasn’t sure what that was. In the meantime, I instead worked a lot on one of my personal projects I’d grown pretty attached to: <i>Extreme Cow Racing</i> and <i>Brick-a-Block</i>. <i>Brick-a-Block</i> was a game I’d made many years back, and with the help of my brother (who I’d taught programming) and my cousin (who was in college as a graphic designer), the game was vastly improved. However, attrition eventually hit us: my cousin found a job, my brother started college, and I-- looking to more easily move to the US (my girlfriend at the time was American)-- began taking courses at Concordia University in order to get a degree in Computer Science.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Away from family and friends and taking full-time courses, many of which felt extremely redundant to me (zero of my college courses counted as credits), I succumbed to depression. As this was an extremely difficult time in my life, I will gloss over it. However, while at University, I not only learned a great deal of new programming knowledge and tricks (such as the importance of time and space complexity), I learned possibly the single most important thing I could: the existence of gender identities outside of the binary.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Discovering I was trans and genderfluid was like turning on the lights for the first time after spending my entire life living in a set of pitch-black rooms. Problems and weird feelings I’d been bumping into all my life-- things I knew were there but never quite knew what they were-- were suddenly crystal clear to me. For the first time, I knew what was missing before I went out into professional life: knowing how I wanted to be <em>me</em>. It was suddenly easier to seek out help, to do everyday tasks, to get my work done, to simply feel <em>happier</em>. It has changed my life, and finally I feel more able to move forward.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">Mafia.gg</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> Returning to live once again with family due safety reasons with the COVID-19 pandemic, I finally put in some work towards professional life. I reached out to an acquaintance of an acquaintance: one of the lead developers for the web browser game <i>Mafia.gg</i>, and told him I wasn’t sure if the team was looking to accept new members, but that I was interested and would love to work on the game with them.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> After a successful interview and an introduction to the team (several of whom I was already acquainted with), I began learning their source code, and with the help of another team member, put forward my first addition to the game: two new roles, one of which was an immediate and huge hit with the community. Confidence bolstered, I’ve since added more to the game. I’ve added vote quoting, a feature long-desired by the community; I’ve created and implemented many new roles; I’ve added flavour text to pre-existing roles and worked with the team in the creation of our new FAQ, making the game friendlier to newer players; and more, including an April Fool’s day event item that has the community to this day impatient for its return.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Today, I continue to add more to the game. I now host popular event games for the community, and I'm regularly designing new roles and quality of life features. I've recently created a new Ready Check feature to give hosts more control over their lobbies before they begin a game!</p>

				<h3 class="other-header">More Projects</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> <i>Mafia.gg</i> isn’t the only thing I’ve been working on since the beginning of the pandemic; I’ve also begun the hobby of creating handmade resin dice sets, and I sell them in my shop on Etsy. As this is all run by myself, in addition to the actual making of the dice, I am also responsible for marketing as well as communication with customers to make sure everything is made to their liking. I’ve successfully made 20 sales so far (14 on Etsy), and have managed to maintain a 5-star rating!</p>
						<p class="other-text"> As mentioned in the beginning, however, workshop-style creation passion pales in comparison to the passion I have for making games. As such, I’ve been working on several new projects, including having created a new board game! With the working title Greedy Wizards, it’s already through seven rounds of playtesting (several have had groups that had no prior knowledge of the game nor input from me-- I was there as an observer only), and so far everyone who’s played it has loved it! While my other projects aren't yet ready to be shown to the public, I'm hard at work nearly every day refining my game design, programming, and storytelling skills.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> With my life on track, it’s time for me to begin a new chapter in my life: with my passion for game design, professionally.</p>

					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<img src="images/mafia.png" class= "imagePortfolioBigIntro border border-2 rounded" alt="Mafia.gg logo">
						<p class="other-text-caption"> "Mafia.gg is an online, text-based version of the classic party game Mafia. Each player is secretly assigned a role aligned with either the town or the mafia. The mafia eliminates one town member per night, and act like innocent town members during the day. The town must combine their wits and eliminate the true mafia before they're outnumbered!" -<a href="https://mafia.gg" target="_blank">Mafia.gg</a> guide page</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> Mafia.gg attracted me like a moth to a flame. When I first joined iateyourpie's Twitch streaming community, I was quickly enraptured by how they played and would find myself up late at night invested in the outcome of each game. When I joined the team around a year later, I was ecstatic to be a part of something I already loved.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Mafia.gg's code-base is primarily split into Java (engine) and Javascript (client). Most of the work I've done has been in the engine, though most of the quality of life features I've added have required some work in the client as well. Both the vote quoting and the upcoming host Ready Check button are examples of this, while the upcoming features that I've designed for our Deck Builder tool (available to patrons) are instead made for a Java Swing application. New roles, however, are done entirely within the engine, and of the 29 roles that have been released since my joining the team, I have either designed or implemented (often both) 13 of them (with more awaiting the next update).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> With each new role I make, there are one or more goals I try to accomplish (alongside making the role both fun and balanced). Oftentimes one of these goals is to combine existing mechanics to make something new and exciting. The Prosecutor role is an example of this; it works similarly to a combination of both the Jailer and the Party Host, which are both existing roles with very different powers that the Prosecutor combines and twists to make something new. The When the Prosecutor chooses a player to interrogate at the end of the day (similarly to the Jailer's power, only the Prosecutor can only do it once), it pulls everybody into one big meeting to watch (much like the Party Host's power, except that more like the Jailer's power, only the Prosecutor and chosen player may speak during the meeting). What the Prosecutor does that's new, however, is that instead of being the one to choose whether or not their target is killed (as the Jailer would), each other player is given the option to decide whether or not they believe the Prosecutor's chosen player is <em>Guilty</em> or <em>Innocent</em>. The chosen player only has the duration of the night to plead their case to everyone watching, and if the majority of players vote <em>Guilty</em>, the player dies. The Prosecutor is therefore a powerful role that not only prevents other night meetings from happening (similarly to the Party Host), which prevents the Mafia's nightly kill, however the Mafia are also on the jury, and thus the results are swayed slightly in their favour; if the town doesn't largely agree on their choices, the decision will be swayed by the Mafia. Since all votes are anonymous, Mafia can use this to attempt to safely protect one of their own, or attempt to kill someone truly innocent.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Another common goal of mine when creating new roles is to engage players more if they find themselves with the basic Villager role. There are a number of roles in the game that see themselves as basic Villager despite being something different, and I enjoy making more of these so that there are different varieties hosts can select for their lobbies. Playing as a basic Villager and then finding out you have a special power later on can be exciting, and so I've created a number of roles that do exactly that: the Trickster, upon being condemned, can choose another player to hand a Gun. However, the Trickster must also choose whether or not this Gun is broken-- and only the Trickster knows the result of that choice. A working Gun will allow the holder to kill a target of their choice, while a broken gun will misfire and kill the holder instead. The Trickster is therefore able to be used to give a trusted player the ability to kill someone they suspect is Mafia, or they can hand it to someone they suspect is Mafia and try and convince them they're trusted so that the player takes themselves out of the game.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> I am a big fan of roles that force the player to think about when and how they're using their power, or roles that force a player to make a choice. One of my newest roles, the Tactician, leaves the player powerless for three days, on the third of which they may choose which power they receive between two other existing roles of the game. The choice they make will affect how they interact with the rest of the game. Another of my newest roles, the Deathcaller, is a mafia-aligned role that will kill a player of their choice during the day, but only if the Deathcaller is currently voting that target. The Deathcaller must carefully time the use of this power so that they're killing someone without revealing themselves, as town will know the Deathcaller is one of the people voting the player that was the recipient of their power. The Prosecutor and Trickster, mentioned above, each have their own sets of choices as well; the timing of the Prosecutor's power and the player they choose can drastically affect the outcome of the game, and the Trickster's choice may cause the right or wrong player's death. All powers must be considered and used carefully to get best results.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Mafia.gg is comprised of eight team members, and we are tightly-knit and work well together. Frequent communication is necessary to make sure our goals align and to make sure everything runs smoothly, and it is not uncommon for us to have small meetings to discuss new ideas and implementation, as well as update organization, community events, and moderation. I find myself collaborating regularly with team members, and I have proven myself as a valued member of the team since my joining. As for the community and user-base, I work diligently to ensure our community stays a safe, friendly, and inclusive environment for all.</p>

				<h3 class="other-header" id="greedy-wizards">Greedy Wizards</h3>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<img src="images/greedyWizards.png" class= "imagePortfolioBigIntro border border-2 rounded" alt="A screenshot of Greedy Wizards in Tabletop Simulator">
						<p class="other-text-caption"> Greedy Wizards is a 4-6 player board game based on cooperation and backstabbing. You must work together to survive and escape the dungeon, but only the player who hoards the most treasures will emerge the winner!</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> Creating fun board games has long been a passion of mine, stretching back to my first ever experience in game design. Greedy Wizards touches upon a genre I find interesting: the concept of being forced to work together when your real goal is to come out on top of a power struggle that lasts the entire game. My design philosophy for Greedy Wizards is broken down into several goals:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="other-text"> To give the players a strong need to cooperate</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To tempt players into looking out for themselves instead</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To prevent the game from ever having a clear winner until the last moment</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To encourage a light-hearted mood through whimsy and goofiness</li>
							<li class="other-text"> To keep the game from going on too long</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="other-text"> Greedy Wizards has several key mechanics in play that force cooperation. The first, and perhaps most important, is the Monster; it begins the game behind the party, and slowly moves towards them throughout the game. If the Monster ever catches the party, the game ends and nobody wins. The party will run into several spaces with the word "STOP" on them. These spaces cannot be passed until players overcome an Obstacle Card. Since the only way to do this is for one or more players to use some of their resources against the Obstacle Card specifically, players are forced to cooperate lest the Monster catch up and end the game. This mechanic takes care of both the first and last points above.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Players' resources come in the form of Scroll Cards. Each of these cards can <em>either</em> be used against an Obstacle Card, or they can be used to advance the players' win condition (each of the 16 different Scroll Cards except one have a different method of doing this that I won't discuss here). Since spending your resources on an Obstacle Card to help the party costs you some of your ability to advance your win condition, the temptation arises to ignore the obstacle and hope another player feels pressured into helping instead. A common strategy players have been using is to spend a Scroll Card to take the Party Leader Token for themselves (which allows them to play first each round), so that there is less chance everyone will leave it to them to save the party from certain doom. This causes even the turn order to become a resource available for players.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Since Treasure Cards, whose total points determine the winner at the end of the game, take up the same hand space as Scroll Cards (with a limit of 10 combined in your hand at one time), players must make a choice between carrying more resources or carrying more treasures. Since Scroll Cards can also be used to either mess with or defend yourself from other players, those with more Treasure Cards will find themselves in less of a position to defend said Treasure Cards from being discarded (or worse: stolen). This design approach is to ensure no player ever pulls so far ahead that they are unreachable in score. This ensures that the game never has a clear winner until the end.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Finally, given that competitive games have the very real possibility of worsening the atmosphere of the game table, I wanted there to be a lot of whimsey and goofiness in the game's flavour text. And so, speaking of flavour, one of the zero-point Treasure Cards is simply named, "Cherry-flavoured leather shoe" - I've had many players wonder aloud how that treasure got to be named as such, for why would anyone taste the shoe to find out? Additionally, each Obstacle Card has flavour text explaining the scenario of the obstacle. For instance, if a lightly-torn painting of a bull asks you to stop and meditate, there are several Scroll Cards that help you overcome the puzzle. Kindling, Fireball and Drench all cause damage to the poor painting, while Mending would remove its tear and potentially cause it to be so thankful that it considers the request complete. Finally, Enlightenment and Silence complete the puzzle in a more normal manner, although you could argue that Silence simply causes the painting to shut up so the party can move on. Functionally, all of these things do the same: overcome the obstacle. It's left up to players' imaginations, however, how exactly the Scroll Card they use got the job done.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Board games are an excellent medium for implementing good game design techniques, and so they are always something I enjoy creating. A good board game, just like any good game, pays special attention to each of its parts and how they work with one-another, so that the end result is not only cohesive-- but fun.</p>

						<p class="other-text"> Back in late 2020, I learned about the new fad that was resin dice crafting. The idea sounded incredible and I wanted in, so after a bunch of research on the things I would need to have and several spreadsheets of planning out costs and funding, I found myself with everything I needed to dive right in. I've come a long way since then, having learned a lot of techniques through both research as well as trial and error, and I've made over 25 sets! Most of these have been sold on my Etsy TTRPG dice store, which I've named Soul Dice.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The processes of creating, managing, and marketing my shop have all been huge learning experiences. All in all, it has been a very satisfying hobby, and it has been a lot of fun creating something both related to my interests and uniquely different from my usual creativity. I plan on continuing it as soon as I get the custom-made dice masters I've ordered in the mail; I have plans to improve my techniques and make even more beautiful dice than before! Speaking of the dice I've made before, the sets shown above are some of my favourite sets that I've created. The one on the bottom-right, named Seafarer's Expedition, is the one I kept for myself. I get a vibe of old seafarer's maps and exploration from the set, and so I painted the numbers brown except for the highest face of each die-- I painted those red, like the X on a fictional pirate map!</p>

						<p class="other-text-caption"> "Brick-a-Block is a two-directional platforming game. You are Leggo, a resourceful frog living in an explosive, ever-changing landscape. The items you find can improve your odds of survival, but how long can you last in a world where even the sky seems out to get you?"</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> Brick-a-Block is a game whose origins date back over 15 years ago. I came up with the original concept while playing Super Smash Bros. Melee, while my brother and I were playing in one of the Kirby levels with blocks that fell from the sky. We would attempt to build bases, and chuck bombs at each other-- sometimes, the blocks themselves were naught but bombs! I decided to make a mini-game based on the idea, with more types of blocks and several usable items for digging or blowing things up. We would have fun playing it once in a while, and the game went through many iterations of me digging it back up again after some time and making a new version with improved graphics, gameplay and features. In 2017, however, I decided it was time to make it into a fully-fledged game of its own. We started as a team of four, and worked to properly flesh out the concept and focus on making it a lot more fun than just a minigame.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Over the next couple years of working on and off in between university work, I continued to improve the game: adding new blocks and items, as well as new features, maps, and game modes. The team I built eventually increased in size to six when we added a sound designer and a pixel artist, and together we developed several versions of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQP4RUyC4ATePOil4oB77A5g2UDnwvSN/view" target="_blank">working demos</a> (though the current developer version is far ahead of the latest of these). However, due to COVID-19 and several other complications in our lives, we felt we no longer had the time to devote to working on the game. The project was shelved for the forseeable future.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Brick-a-Block takes the aforementioned "blocks falling from the sky that you can make a base out of" concept and pushes it to the extreme. With over 20 different types of blocks, each with their own unique effects and visual indicators, the landscape itself becomes rife with dangers and variety. Since I wanted to give Leggo some level of control over the landscape, there are also around 15 different items, split into two categories: passive items and active items. Passive items function similarly to equipped gear with durability that would run out over time, and active items which had one-use effects. Passive items changed the way you interacted with the game (for example, the Pogo Stick would make you jump higher, and the Climbing Gear would allow you to hook onto walls and perform wall jumps). Active items, on the other hand, had quick and snappy effects (such as the Lobbomb, which allowed you to toss a stick of dynamite to blow up blocks, or the Flash Freeze, which halted all falling blocks and converted them to Ice Blocks). Both types of items spawned frequently, so that the player would always have something to do beyond dodging obstacles (we even had a special function for spawning items more quickly when the player was trapped between blocks, so as to not let them feel stuck for long).</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The game was built around maximum replayability; block spawns, item spawns, the Randonoid item's effects, and several other aspects of the game are all consistently random while playing, making every single time played a different experience. We also had several game modes: Climb, in which you attepmted to survive while the falling blocks slowly built upon themselves until you climbed 300 blocks up all the way from a molten lava beginning zone up to outer space and beyond; Endless, in which you played more contained levels at a casual pace with no real goal beyond surviving in a sandbox you got to affect with your presence; and Collection (shown above), which worked similarly to Endless, but with specially-designed levels of increasing difficulty for each map type in which the goal was to collect eight or more frog coins to complete the level (collecting more than the required amount would increase your high score).</p>

						<p class="other-text-caption"> Wolf Wool Save You is a stealth game created using C# and Unity on a team of five for a university project.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="other-text"> In Wolf Wool Save You, you play as a non-violent wolf whose voice was stolen by nefarious sheep. To retrieve it, you must find your way into their hidden lair in a nearby well, and sneak past the guards until you reach the chest, containing your voice, near the end. Finding your voice alerts all sheep to your presence, after which you must survive an escape sequence to emerge from the lair victorious. As one of the AI programmers for this game, my responsibility was the pathfinding each sheep uses when trying to hunt you down once you've either been noticed or have begun the escape sequence that lasts until the end of the game.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The first check a sheep performs for chase-pathfinding is to line trace to your character. If you're in direct line of sight, they will simply charge straight at you, avoiding any need for heavier computation. If you're not in line of sight, it checks whether or not you're in the same <em>room</em>, which is a different ID given to each section of the map with assigned connection points to one-another and labeled "exits" for each connection point. If you are in the same room, that infers that there's an obstacle between you and the sheep (otherwise the line tracing would have succeeded), and it uses basic A* pathfinding to reach you. If you aren't in the same room, it calculates the fastest room path to the room you're in using a different method of A* meant for nodes to determine which exit of the room to head towards, and then it uses the basic method to reach that exit before entering the next.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> During the stealth portion of the game, the sheep only registers the location you were last seen, and pathfinds to that location (if you are found again, it updates). Once reaching that point, if you are not found, the sheep concludes their search for you and pathfinds back to the closest checkpoint in their patrol pattern. In the escape sequence, however, the sheep are always aware of your location, and their destination point updates each time you move.</p>

Now, your friends are your ruthless opponents as you each attempt to shift the odds, trying to hit the jackpot and avoid the after-race cleanup!" -Extreme Cow Racing instruction manual</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p class="other-text"> I came up with the idea for Extreme Cow Racing back in 2009, when my brother and I found a minigame in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles about cow racing. The concept of the minigame was pretty simple: you bet on one of eight cows, trying to determine which will win the race. However, these are cows; they move at their own pace. We found ourselves on the edges of our seats shouting at the cows to keep going, "Stop taking breaks! You're so close, please just go-- noo!" The cow would halt to munch on some grass, another cow would pass it, and would win the race instead. It was a fun minigame, but not I wanted to make something better. From that desire, <i>Extreme Cow Racing</i> was born.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Extreme Cow Racing has the players bet on 2-3 cows (depending on number of players) rather than just one, and no longer are you only always betting on which cow finishes first; you try and guess their placement (eg. betting that the yellow cow will be 3rd, the blue cow 4th, and the purple cow last). Additionally, and the most important change that Extreme Cow Racing brings to this concept: the players now have the ability to influence the race. Players are given Modifier Tokens: five each, that replenish every round. Each player may select two of these tokens to place on different cows face-down, and when it's time for the cows to move, how much they move (if at all) can be affected. The effects of tokens vary from minor increases or decreases in the amount that cow moves, to much larger effects such as big boosts only to cows in behind, or even cowtipping: knocking the cow over and preventing it from moving again until someone finds a token that can get them back on their feet.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> In the end, however, these are still just cows; they move at their own pace. It was very important to keep this core concept as part of the game, and this is done via Moovement Cards: the manifestation of each cow's free will. Each round, after the players have played their tokens, a Moovement Card is drawn for each cow. These cards each have a number from 1-3 (1 being the most common and 3 being the most rare), indicating how far a cow desires to move that turn, before applying players' modifier effects to that number. However, there's another type of Moovement Card that can be drawn: "Moo" cards, designated by a red 'M', which signify the cow's desire to simply stay put and do nothing. If one of these is drawn, that cow simply refuses to move, and none of the modifiers that affect the amount the cow moves have any effect that turn. With these added, we found that once again we would be at the edge of our seats, begging that the each cow wouldn't ignore our desperate efforts to get them to just <em>moove</em> when we wanted.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> Of course, setting an atmosphere of fun and whimsy is extremely important to me in a competitive board game, and each of our Moovement Cards has a terrible cow joke written on it. "What do you call the milk from a cow that's just given birth? De-calf-einated!" - "What happened to the lost cattle? Nobody's herd." - and so on. These dumb jokes, combined with the cows' own refusal to cooperate with the people 'steaking' their imaginary fortunes on the race, keep the game silly and light-hearted.</p>
						<p class="other-text"> The game very quickly became a family favourite that we still often play to this day. Many years and many iterations since its inception (altered by various first-time and experienced players' playtests), the game is more or less completed, and awaits some time when I have the resources to spend on getting it polished and released to the public.</p>
